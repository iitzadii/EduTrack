# EduTrack â€” Student Performance Monitoring System

**EduTrack** is a lightweight desktop application built with **CustomTkinter** for managing student records. Teachers can create CSV record files, add student marks via a form, and view/edit records. Students can view records (via file selection). The app is designed as a single-page application (SPA) for the main UI, while some actions (like adding records) open a focused popup window.

---

## Features
- Teacher & Student login screens.
- Teacher can create new CSV record files (pre-populated with headers).
- Teacher can add student records (marks) to a selected CSV file via a popup form.
- View records in a readable table with scrollbars.
- Simple and consistent UI styling using CustomTkinter.

### Password (Teacher Login)
The default **teacher password** for testing is: **aditya**

You can **change the password** by editing the source code in the following section:

```python
# ------------------- Page 2: Teacher Password -------------------
```
**Note:** For security, avoid committing real passwords to a public repository. You can also replace the hard-coded password with an environment variable to keep it secure.
